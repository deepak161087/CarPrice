## Key Findings

### 1. Age and Mileage Are the Biggest Price Drivers
- **Car age** strongly lowers value — each additional year reduces price by approximately **$3,400**.
- **Mileage** also negatively impacts price — higher odometer readings correlate with lower prices.
- Prioritize sourcing cars with lower mileage and newer model years to maximize resale value.

### 2. Engine Size (Cylinders) Affects Pricing
- Vehicles with **3 or 4 cylinders** tend to sell for significantly less than other engine sizes.
- This likely reflects consumer preferences for power and performance.
- Consider inventory balance — while smaller engines may appeal to fuel-efficiency buyers, they generally command lower prices.

### 3. Drive Type Influences Value
- **Front-wheel drive (FWD)** vehicles tend to have lower prices compared to other drive configurations.
- Rear-wheel and all-wheel drive cars generally maintain higher values.
- Use this insight to tailor your buying strategy depending on the market demand and price targets.
